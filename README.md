### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

Yes, the topics discussed in the labs were really helpful. The required features were a combination of what we learned and used in labs 1, 2, and 3. At first I had trouble with some of the code in javascript such as event listeners and API‚Äôs, but reviewing the labs strengthened my understanding. For me, one of the most challenging parts were using CSS as I had troubles with CSS positioning.


* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
If I had more time then I would add more functionality to the interface. One way I could improve the user interface is to add horizontal scrolling for specific categories, similar to how popular content platforms look like, such as Netflix or Hulu. This means the site would be broken down into many different sections based on what‚Äôs trending, recommendations, genres, etc. Since the API had optional query strings, I would make a dropdown menu for the options such as displaying a specific country for the current movies. Another thing I would do is to make my code more readable because that is something I can improve on. 

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

What did not go well was initially, I decided to code without having a plan. This caused me to write very messy code in which I had to delete most of what I wrote and had a hard time fixing bugs simply because I could not follow what was going on due to my own unorganization. Additionally, I tried refactoring my code but I did this in big steps which caused even more confusion. Next time, I will be sure to take small steps in terms of writing cleaner code and trying to make the logic of the program cleaner. I would have liked to implement the embedded youtube videos but I didn‚Äôt finish the other parts fast enough and thought I wouldn‚Äôt have enough time to fully implement it.

### Open-source libraries used

- Add any links to open-source libraries used in your project.

### Shout out

Give a shout out to somebody from your cohort that especially helped you during your project. This can be a fellow peer, instructor, TA, mentor, etc.

I want to shout out to my peers, mentors, and instructors as they have helped me in areas I needed help in and I am grateful to learn from them.
